- Having a lot of ink can mess with rendering (bounces between perspectives)
  -> missing invalidation for high resolution cache
- dragging around can sometimes happen with less than 60 touchesMoved per second
- stutternig/lagging on rendering of translation (related to above) and zooming (potentially related)
  -> try commenting out the pdf rendering (?) and high quality rendering
